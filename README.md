# adblocker-detection-minimal
The most minimal adblocker detection you will ever need. Just add this script to your website

Usage:
``` js
if(detect_adblock())
   alert('ADBLOCK DETECTED')
```


Randomize the function name to prevent adblockers from just patching this function out.
The function will return true if adblocker is detected
